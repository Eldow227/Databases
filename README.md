In this repository I present my SQL code.

Hospital DataBase

This is simple and repeatable code, I did not put any data into the database.
I wanted to present ability to create good and practical database according to database schema I get.
I choose  Hospital DataBase schema because it is not the easiest schema, it posses many foreign keys and relations between tables. In future I plan to add some real data into it.
